AIX ATTRIBUTES
 ------------
 nimprime :   The name of NIM server, if not set default is the AIX MN.
              If Linux MN, then must be set for support of mixed cluster (TBD).

 useSSHonAIX:  (yes/1 or no/0). Default is yes.  The support for rsh/rcp is deprecated.
 useNFSv4onAIX:  (yes/1 or no/0). If yes, NFSv4 will be used with NIM. If no,
               NFSv3 will be used with NIM. Default is no.

 -----------------
DATABASE ATTRIBUTES
 -----------------
 auditnosyslog: If set to 1, then commands will only be written to the auditlog table.
                This attribute set to 1 and auditskipcmds=ALL means no logging of commands.
                Default is to write to both the auditlog table and syslog.
 auditskipcmds: List of commands and/or client types that will not be
                written to the auditlog table and syslog. See auditnosyslog.
                &#39;ALL&#39; means all cmds will be skipped. If attribute is null, all
                commands will be written.
                clienttype:web would skip all commands from the web client
                For example: tabdump,nodels,clienttype:web
                will not log tabdump,nodels and any web client commands.

 databaseloc:    Directory where we create the db instance directory.
                 Default is /var/lib. Only DB2 is currently supported.
                 Do not use the directory in the site.installloc or
                 installdir attribute. This attribute must not be changed
                 once db2sqlsetup script has been run and DB2 has been setup.

 excludenodes:  A set of comma separated nodes and/or groups that would automatically
                be subtracted from any noderange, it can be used for excluding some
                failed nodes for any xCAT commands. See the &#39;noderange&#39; manpage for
                details on supported formats.

 nodestatus:  If set to &#39;n&#39;, the nodelist.status column will not be updated during
              the node deployment, node discovery and power operations. The default
              is to update.

 skiptables:  Comma separated list of tables to be skipped by dumpxCATdb

 skipvalidatelog:  If set to 1, then getcredentials and getpostscripts calls will not
                   be logged in syslog.

 -------------
DHCP ATTRIBUTES
 -------------
 dhcpinterfaces:  The network interfaces DHCP should listen on.  If it is the same for all
                  nodes, use a comma-separated list of the NICs.  To specify different NICs
                  for different nodes, use the format: &quot;xcatmn|eth1,eth2;service|bond0&quot;,
                  where xcatmn is the name of the management node, DHCP should listen on
                  the eth1 and eth2 interfaces.  All the nodes in group &#39;service&#39; should
                  listen on the &#39;bond0&#39; interface.

                  To disable the genesis kernel from being sent to specific interfaces, a
                  &#39;:noboot&#39; option can be appended to the interface name.  For example,
                  if the management node has two interfaces, eth1 and eth2, disable
                  genesis from being sent to eth1 using: &quot;eth1:noboot,eth2&quot;.

 dhcpsetup:  If set to &#39;n&#39;, it will skip the dhcp setup process in the nodeset cmd.

 dhcplease:  The lease time for the dhcp client. The default value is 43200.

 disjointdhcps:  If set to &#39;1&#39;, the .leases file on a service node only contains
                 the nodes it manages. The default value is &#39;0&#39;.
                 &#39;0&#39; value means include all the nodes in the subnet.

 pruneservices:  Whether to enable service pruning when noderm is run (i.e.
                 removing DHCP entries when noderm is executed)

 managedaddressmode: The mode of networking configuration during node provision.
                     If set to &#39;static&#39;, the network configuration will be configured
                     in static mode based on the node and network definition on MN.
                     If set to &#39;dhcp&#39;, the network will be configured with dhcp protocol.
                     The default is &#39;dhcp&#39;.

 ------------
DNS ATTRIBUTES
 ------------
 dnshandler:  Name of plugin that handles DNS setup for makedns.

 domain:  The DNS domain name used for the cluster.

 forwarders:  The DNS servers at your site that can provide names outside of the cluster.
              The makedns command will configure the DNS on the management node to forward
              requests it does not know to these servers. Note that the DNS servers on the
              service nodes will ignore this value and always be configured to forward
              to the management node.

 master:  The hostname of the xCAT management node, as known by the nodes.

 nameservers:  A comma delimited list of DNS servers that each node in the cluster should
               use. This value will end up in the nameserver settings of the
               /etc/resolv.conf on each node. It is common (but not required) to set
               this attribute value to the IP addr of the xCAT management node, if
               you have set up the DNS on the management node by running makedns.
               In a hierarchical cluster, you can also set this attribute to
               &quot;&lt;xcatmaster&gt;&quot; to mean the DNS server for each node should be the
               node that is managing it (either its service node or the management
               node).

 externaldns:  To specify that external dns is used. If externaldns is set to any value
               then, makedns command will not start the local nameserver on xCAT MN.
               Default is to start the local nameserver.

 dnsupdaters:  The value are &#39;,&#39; separated string which will be added to the zone config
               section. This is an interface for user to add configuration entries to
               the zone sections in named.conf.

 dnsinterfaces:  The network interfaces DNS should listen on.  If it is the same for all
                 nodes, use a simple comma-separated list of NICs.  To specify different
                 NICs for different nodes, use the format: &quot;xcatmn|eth1,eth2;service|bond0&quot;,
                 where xcatmn is the name of the management node, and DNS should listen on
                 the eth1 and eth2 interfaces.  All the nods in group &#39;service&#39; should
                 listen on the &#39;bond0&#39; interface.

                 NOTE: If using this attribute to block certain interfaces, make sure
                 the IP maps to your hostname of xCAT MN is not blocked since xCAT needs
                 to use this IP to communicate with the local NDS server on MN.

 -------------------------
HARDWARE CONTROL ATTRIBUTES
 -------------------------
 blademaxp:  The maximum number of concurrent processes for blade hardware control.

 ea_primary_hmc:  The hostname of the HMC that the Integrated Switch Network
                  Management Event Analysis should send hardware serviceable
                  events to for processing and potentially sending to IBM.

 ea_backup_hmc:  The hostname of the HMC that the Integrated Switch Network
                  Management Event Analysis should send hardware serviceable
                  events to if the primary HMC is down.

 enableASMI:  (yes/1 or no/0). If yes, ASMI method will be used after fsp-api. If no,
               when fsp-api is used, ASMI method will not be used. Default is no.

 fsptimeout:  The timeout, in milliseconds, to use when communicating with FSPs.

 hwctrldispatch:  Whether or not to send hw control operations to the service
                  node of the target nodes. Default is &#39;y&#39;.(At present, this attribute
                  is only used for IBM Flex System)

 ipmidispatch:  Whether or not to send ipmi hw control operations to the service
                node of the target compute nodes. Default is &#39;y&#39;.

 ipmimaxp:  The max # of processes for ipmi hw ctrl. The default is 64. Currently,
            this is only used for HP hw control.

 ipmiretries:  The # of retries to use when communicating with BMCs. Default is 3.

 ipmisdrcache:  If set to &#39;no&#39;, then the xCAT IPMI support will not cache locally
                the target node&#39;s SDR cache to improve performance.

 ipmitimeout:  The timeout to use when communicating with BMCs. Default is 2.
               This attribute is currently not used.

 maxssh:  The max # of SSH connections at any one time to the hw ctrl point for PPC
          This parameter doesn&#39;t take effect on the rpower command.
          It takes effects on other PPC hardware control command
          getmacs/rnetboot/rbootseq and so on. Default is 8.

 syspowerinterval:  For SystemP CECs, this is the number of seconds the rpower command
                    will wait between performing the action for each CEC.  For SystemX
                    IPMI servers, this is the number of seconds the rpower command will
                    wait between powering on &lt;syspowermaxnodes&gt; nodes at a time.  This
                    value is used to control the power on speed in large clusters.
                    Default is 0.

 syspowermaxnodes:  The number of servers to power on at one time before waiting
                    &#39;syspowerinterval&#39; seconds to continue on to the next set of
                    nodes.  If the noderange given to rpower includes nodes served
                    by different service nodes, it will try to spread each set of
                    nodes across the service nodes evenly. Currently only used for
                    IPMI servers and must be set if &#39;syspowerinterval&#39; is set.

 powerinterval:  The number of seconds the rpower command to LPARs will wait between
                 performing the action for each LPAR. LPARs of different HCPs
                 (HMCs or FSPs) are done in parallel. This is used to limit the
                 cluster boot up speed in large clusters. Default is 0.  This is
                 currently only used for system p hardware.

 ppcmaxp:  The max # of processes for PPC hw ctrl. If there are more than ppcmaxp
           hcps, this parameter will take effect. It will control the max number of
           processes for PPC hardware control commands. Default is 64.

 ppcretry:  The max # of PPC hw connection attempts to HMC before failing.
           It only takes effect on the hardware control commands through HMC.
           Default is 3.

 ppctimeout:  The timeout, in milliseconds, to use when communicating with PPC hw
              through HMC. It only takes effect on the hardware control commands
              through HMC. Default is 0.

 snmpc:  The snmp community string that xcat should use when communicating with the
         switches.

 ---------------------------
INSTALL/DEPLOYMENT ATTRIBUTES
 ---------------------------
 cleanupxcatpost:  (yes/1 or no/0). Set to &#39;yes&#39; or &#39;1&#39; to clean up the /xcatpost
                   directory on the stateless and statelite nodes after the
                   postscripts are run. Default is no.

 db2installloc:  The location which the service nodes should mount for
                 the db2 code to install. Format is hostname:/path.  If hostname is
                 omitted, it defaults to the management node. Default is /mntdb2.

 defserialflow:  The default serial flow - currently only used by the mknb command.

 defserialport:  The default serial port - currently only used by mknb.

 defserialspeed:  The default serial speed - currently only used by mknb.

 genpasswords:  Automatically generate random passwords for BMCs when configuring
                them.

 installdir:  The local directory name used to hold the node deployment packages.

 installloc:  The location from which the service nodes should mount the
              deployment packages in the format hostname:/path.  If hostname is
              omitted, it defaults to the management node. The path must
              match the path in the installdir attribute.

 iscsidir:  The path to put the iscsi disks in on the mgmt node.

 mnroutenames:  The name of the routes to be setup on the management node.
                It is a comma separated list of route names that are defined in the
                routes table.

 runbootscripts:  If set to &#39;yes&#39; the scripts listed in the postbootscripts
                  attribute in the osimage and postscripts tables will be run during
                  each reboot of stateful (diskful) nodes. This attribute has no
                  effect on stateless and statelite nodes. Run the following
                  command after you change the value of this attribute:
                  &#39;updatenode &lt;nodes&gt; -P setuppostbootscripts&#39;

 precreatemypostscripts: (yes/1 or no/0). Default is no. If yes, it will
              instruct xCAT at nodeset and updatenode time to query the db once for
              all of the nodes passed into the cmd and create the mypostscript file
              for each node, and put them in a directory of tftpdir(such as: /tftpboot)
              If no, it will not generate the mypostscript file in the tftpdir.

 setinstallnic:  Set the network configuration for installnic to be static.

 sharedtftp:  Set to 0 or no, xCAT should not assume the directory
              in tftpdir is mounted on all on Service Nodes. Default is 1/yes.
              If value is set to a hostname, the directory in tftpdir
              will be mounted from that hostname on the SN

 sharedinstall:  Indicates if a shared file system will be used for installation
                 resources. Possible values are: &#39;no&#39;, &#39;sns&#39;, or &#39;all&#39;.  &#39;no&#39;
                 means a shared file system is not being used.  &#39;sns&#39; means a
                 shared filesystem is being used across all service nodes.
                 &#39;all&#39; means that the management as well as the service nodes
                 are all using a common shared filesystem. The default is &#39;no&#39;.

 xcatconfdir:  Where xCAT config data is (default /etc/xcat).

 xcatdebugmode:  the xCAT debug level. xCAT provides a batch of techniques
                 to help user debug problems while using xCAT, especially on OS provision,
                 such as collecting logs of the whole installation process and accessing
                 the installing system via ssh, etc. These techniques will be enabled
                 according to different xCAT debug levels specified by &#39;xcatdebugmode&#39;,
                 currently supported values:
                   &#39;0&#39;:  disable debug mode
                   &#39;1&#39;:  enable basic debug mode
                   &#39;2&#39;:  enable expert debug mode
                 For the details on &#39;basic debug mode&#39; and &#39;expert debug mode&#39;,
                 refer to xCAT documentation.

 --------------------
REMOTESHELL ATTRIBUTES
 --------------------
 nodesyncfiledir:  The directory on the node, where xdcp will rsync the files

 SNsyncfiledir:  The directory on the Service Node, where xdcp will rsync the files
                 from the MN that will eventually be rsync&#39;d to the compute nodes.

 sshbetweennodes:  Comma separated list of groups of compute nodes to enable passwordless
                   root ssh to the nodes during install or running &#39;xdsh -K&#39;. The default
                   is ALLGROUPS.  Set to NOGROUPS to disable.

                   Service Nodes are not affected by this attribute as they are always
                   configured with passwordless root access.
                   If using the zone table, this attribute in not used.

 -----------------
SERVICES ATTRIBUTES
 -----------------
 consoleondemand:  When set to &#39;yes&#39;, conserver connects and creates the console
                   output only when the user opens the console. Default is &#39;no&#39; on
                   Linux, &#39;yes&#39; on AIX.

 httpport:    The port number that the booting/installing nodes should contact the
              http server on the MN/SN on. It is your responsibility to configure
              the http server to listen on that port - xCAT will not do that.

 nmapoptions: Additional options for the nmap command. nmap is used in pping,
              nodestat, xdsh -v and updatenode commands. Sometimes additional
              performance tuning may be needed for nmap due to network traffic.
              For example, if the network response time is too slow, nmap may not
              give stable output. You can increase the timeout value by specifying
              &#39;--min-rtt-timeout 1s&#39;. xCAT will append the options defined here to
              the nmap command.

 ntpservers:  A comma delimited list of NTP servers for the service node and
              the compute node to sync with. The keyword &lt;xcatmaster&gt; means that
              the node&#39;s NTP server is the node that is managing it
              (either its service node or the management node).

 extntpservers:  A comma delimited list of external NTP servers for the xCAT
                 management node to sync with. If it is empty, the NTP server
                 will use the management node&#39;s own hardware clock to calculate
                 the system date and time

 svloglocal:  If set to 1, syslog on the service node will not get forwarded to the
              management node.

 timezone:  (e.g. America/New_York)

 tftpdir:  The tftp directory path. Default is /tftpboot

 tftpflags:  The flags that used to start tftpd. Default is &#39;-v -l -s /tftpboot
               -m /etc/tftpmapfile4xcat.conf&#39; if tftplfags is not set

 useNmapfromMN:  When set to yes, nodestat command should obtain the node status
                 using nmap (if available) from the management node instead of the
                 service node. This will improve the performance in a flat network.

 vsftp:  Default is &#39;n&#39;. If set to &#39;y&#39;, xcatd on the management node will automatically
         start vsftpd.  (vsftpd must be installed by the admin).  This setting does not
         apply to service nodes.  For service nodes, set servicenode.ftpserver=1.

 FQDNfirst:  Fully Qualified Domain Name first. If set to 1/yes/enable, the /etc/hosts
             entries generated by &#39;makehosts&#39; will put the FQDN before the PQDN(Partially
             Qualified Domain Name). Otherwise, the original behavior will be performed.

 hierarchicalattrs:  Table attributes(e.g. postscripts, postbootscripts) that will be
                     included hierarchically. Attribute values for all the node&#39;s groups
                     will be applied to the node in the groups&#39; order except the repeat one.

 -----------------------
VIRTUALIZATION ATTRIBUTES
 -----------------------
 usexhrm:  Have xCAT execute the xHRM script when booting up KVM guests to configure
           the virtual network bridge.

 vcenterautojoin:  When set to no, the VMWare plugin will not attempt to auto remove
                   and add hypervisors while trying to perform operations.  If users
                   or tasks outside of xCAT perform the joining this assures xCAT
                   will not interfere.

 vmwarereconfigonpower:  When set to no, the VMWare plugin will make no effort to
                         push vm.cpus/vm.memory updates from xCAT to VMWare.

 persistkvmguests:  Keep the kvm definition on the kvm hypervisor when you power off
                    the kvm guest node. This is useful for you to manually change the
                    kvm xml definition file in virsh for debugging. Set anything means
                    enable.

 --------------------
XCAT DAEMON ATTRIBUTES
 --------------------
 useflowcontrol:  (yes/1 or no/0). If yes, the postscript processing on each node
               contacts xcatd on the MN/SN using a lightweight UDP packet to wait
               until xcatd is ready to handle the requests associated with
               postscripts.  This prevents deploying nodes from flooding xcatd and
               locking out admin interactive use. This value works with the
               xcatmaxconnections and xcatmaxbatch attributes. Is not supported on AIX.
               If the value is no, nodes sleep for a random time before contacting
               xcatd, and retry. The default is no.
               See the following document for details:
               Hints_and_Tips_for_Large_Scale_Clusters

 xcatmaxconnections:  Number of concurrent xCAT protocol requests before requests
                      begin queueing. This applies to both client command requests
                      and node requests, e.g. to get postscripts. Default is 64.

 xcatmaxbatchconnections:  Number of concurrent xCAT connections allowed from the nodes.
                      Value must be less than xcatmaxconnections. Default is 50.

 xcatdport:  The port used by the xcatd daemon for client/server communication.

 xcatiport:  The port used by xcatd to receive install status updates from nodes.

 xcatlport:  The port used by xcatd command log writer process to collect command output.

 xcatsslversion:  The ssl version by xcatd. Default is SSLv3.

 xcatsslciphers:  The ssl cipher by xcatd. Default is 3DES.
